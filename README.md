### Abstract
In this project we focus on the analysis and modeling of one of the most famous electric guitar effect pedal, the phaser MXR Phase 90. We exploit the Wave Digital Filter white-box method in order to create the physical model of the device, mainly focusing on the implementation of the operational amplifiers using nullors and on the description of a novel non-iterative explicit approach to implement the non-linear behavior of the Junction Field Effect Transistors (JFETs) as voltage-controlled resistors. To validate the proposed physical model, both a MATLAB implementation and a real-time audio plug-in JUCE Framework have been developed and compared with the LTSpice reference circuit.
